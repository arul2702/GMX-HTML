            sensory processing, in a lab-grown human-brain model."<br></i></b>The brain organoids that Hartung currently
            uses would need to be scaled up for OI, or organoid intelligence.Organoids are lab-grown tissues that resemble organs.<br> 
            These three-dimensional structures, usually derived from stem cells, have been used in labs for nearly two decades, 
            where scientists have been able to avoid harmful human<br>or animal testing by experimenting on the stand-ins for kidneys,
            lungs and other organs.<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/new-ai-organoid-intelligence-field-johns-hopkins/" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Read more</a>
