    <h1>Parallel Universe</h1>
    <p>Parallel universe theory is a hypothesis in physics and philosophy 
    suggesting that our <b>universe may be one of many universes that together comprise 
    everything that exists: the multiverse.</b><br> As originally proposed, it stated that for 
    every single possible quantum outcome there exists a parallel universe.</p>
